# Real-Time Camera Calibration (Logitech Webcam)

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates **real-time camera calibration** using OpenCV and a Logitech webcam.  
It dynamically detects a chessboard pattern from a live video feed, computes intrinsic parameters, and applies distortion correction while the camera is running.  

## ⚙️ Features
- Live video stream processing  
- Automatic chessboard detection  
- Real-time collection of calibration data  
- Calculation of camera matrix and distortion coefficients  
- On-the-fly distortion correction  

## 🚀 Why This Matters
Real-time calibration is essential when the camera position or environment changes frequently.  
It ensures accurate results for **AR/VR, robotics, simulations, and computer vision pipelines**.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Numpy  
- Jupyter/Google Colab  

## 📷 Workflow
1. Capture live frames from the Logitech webcam  
2. Detect chessboard corners  
3. Collect calibration data dynamically  
4. Compute camera parameters & distortion coefficients  
5. Apply distortion correction in real-time
